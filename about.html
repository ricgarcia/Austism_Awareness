	       <br><br>
          Autism, or autism spectrum disorder, refers to a range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication, as well as by unique strengths and differences. We now know that there is not one autism but many types, caused by different combinations of genetic and environmental influences.<br><br>
          The term “spectrum” reflects the wide variation in challenges and strengths possessed by each person with autism.<br><br>
          Autism’s most-obvious signs tend to appear between 2 and 3 years of age. In some cases, it can be diagnosed as early as 18 months. Some developmental delays associated with autism can be identified and addressed even earlier. Autism Speaks urges parents with concerns to seek evaluation without delay, as early intervention can improve outcomes.

          <span class="bold">Fast Facts About Autism</span>
          <br><br>
            - The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates autism’s prevalence as 1 in 68 children in the United States. This includes 1 in 42 boys and 1 in 189 girls.<br><br>
            - Around one third of people with autism remain nonverbal.<br><br>
            - Around one third of people with autism have an intellectual disability.<br><br>
            - Certain medical and mental health issues frequently accompany autism. They include gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, seizures, sleep disturbances, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and phobias.

			     <span class="bold">How Is Autism Treated?</span>
			    <br><br>
			    There is currently no one standard treatment for autism.<br><br>
          But there are many ways to help minimize the symptoms and maximize abilities. People who have ASD have the best chance of using all of their abilities and skills if they receive appropriate therapies and interventions.<br><br>
          The most effective therapies and interventions are often different for each person. However, most people with ASD respond best to highly structured and specialized programs.1In some cases, treatment can help people with autism to function at near-normal levels.<br><br>
          Research shows that early diagnosis and interventions, such as during preschool or before, are more likely to have major positive effects on symptoms and later skills. Read more about early interventions for autism.<br><br>
          Because there can be overlap in symptoms between ASD and other disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),2 it’s important that treatment focus on a person’s specific needs, rather than the diagnostic label.<br><br>
